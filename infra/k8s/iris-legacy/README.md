# Iris(Legacy)

This iris service is connected to RabbitMQ hosted on AWS, which is considered legacy.

We are moving toward on-premise Kubernetes clusters and RabbitMQ hosted on-premise, so this service will be deprecated soon.

We may use this service when implementing failover systems within AWS(AmazonMQ).
