# Postgres in kubernetes

This deployment is intended only for stage environment.

It is ideal to use AWS RDS in stage environment, to mock as close as possible the production environment.
However, we've decided to use on-premise Postgres in stage environment to save costs.
Strongly recommend to use AWS RDS in production environment for better reliability and scalability.
